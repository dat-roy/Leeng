# Leeng - A free platform of learning English.

_It was my first static website, when I started from scratch with basic HTML, CSS, JS (2020)._

The most interesting part I learned from it is _responsive design_, which makes my website more compatible with many devices :P

Let's try it: [Here](https://dat-roy.github.io/Leeng/)
